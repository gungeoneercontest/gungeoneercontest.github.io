        Tall and slim with blindingly bright hair. Though his face changes frequently, he seems to always have sunglasses on to double down on the anonymity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Clyde has a charismatic personality, with a sense of humor that leaves him laughing in most any situation. Though the light in his eyes has dimmed, he tries to maintain the air of confidence that got him this far in life.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Clyde, The Gambler, is a sharp-witted man with quick hands and a silver tongue. He and his best-gal, Bonnie, have been running hustles and heists since they were teens. They raked in riches, and upped the ante with every adventure. As they grew older, they explored and adventured through the stars, changing their identities and appearance yearly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With no end in sight, the day came when they decided to target an average casino on a backwoods planet just outside their most recently hit territory. Things were going smoothly until the dealer pulled a gun on Bonnie. Huge enforcers were on her in no time and Clyde had to run. Smith, the owner, and his brother, Wesson, had been tipped off. Shots erupted as Bonnie tried to escape. Clyde was too far to help, and as he looked back he saw what were the last moments of his beloved's life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Clyde cursed himself for running and started down a dark path, throwing his days away to booze and dice. After months of grieving, he finally caught wind of an ancient tomb with a mystical weapon that could kill his past. Skeptical, but desperate, Clyde found his way to the Gungeon, and sought the bullet that would give him a second chance to fight for his girl, and to redeem himself in his own eyes.

          <h3 class=name> UnLoaded Die </h3>
          <a href=gfx/unloaded_die.png> <img src=gfx/unloaded_die.png> </a>
          <p>
            The UnLoaded Die generates a random buff on use. The buff is denoted by the number that appears on the front of the Dice. (1: Half Heart Recovery, 2: + Running Speed, 3: + Reload &amp; Fire Rate, 4: +1 Armor, 5: Reveal Adjacent Rooms, 6: +1 Damage). These buffs (except for the heart, armor, and reveal) last for a short item duration. When the item recharges, the image changes to match the buff that it will use. (I prefer this type of RNG, proactive instead of reactive I guess.)

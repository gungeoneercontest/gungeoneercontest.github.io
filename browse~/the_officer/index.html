      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        A rouge soldier killed his soldiers in his encampment when they were sleeping and he survived a shot to the stomach. Now he wishes to know who did it and kill him before he does harm.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        The Officer has slightly reduced health from his battle wounds from the rouge Soldier.

          <p>
            You use your disciplining methods to make a foe nearby an ally but only until the end of the room and the enemy has to be weak enough to take your pressuring.(So no one can just turn an op enemy into his own bodyguard.)The enemy will disappear after defeating the room.

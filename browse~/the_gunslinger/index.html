      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Years ago, in the Wild West, The Gunslinger was the sharpest quickest shooter around, trained by the Gunsling King himself, until Lich came through town! They butted heads on who called the shots with the bandits and thieves, and had a showdown, 1v1, at high noon, but the Lichy trigger Finger was just too much for the Outlaw. Allowing The Lich to run the town and the residents live in fear.  The past is fighting the human younger version of Lich in the Wild West theme setting, with tumbleweeds blowing by, with nothing but Antique revolvers.

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        The Gunslinger starts with 2 heart containers. Active item will be the Cigarettes. Passive item will be "The Dusty Bandanna" stating: Grants 50% weapon accuracy and range increase while at full health. "This is gonna be a bad storm! We gotta push through!" I feel as though this character would be a great addition to the game for the sake of being a higher skilled Gungeon player. The lack of starting health with the Cigs would be a great high risk, high reward concept. Thank you!

      <p>
        The Martian (or Popper) is a short, green alien who escaped his hidden planet of Xor. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        It was Popper himself that led the Hegemony of Man to his peaceful and quiet planet, after being tricked into giving them the planets coordinates by a Hegemony spy. Not wanting to relive the moment in his mind ever again, he flees to the gungeon to stop the spy from ever reaching his home planet
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        The Martian cannot pick up any active items, doing so will convert them into an amount of robot parts which corresponds to the tier of item he picked up (D will give 1, C will give 2, B will give three, A will give 5 and S will give 10). He also begins with one armour in addition to the normal three heart containers, similar to The Marine.
      </p>

          <img class=small src=gfx/the_zipper.png>
          <p>
            When an enemy is hit with this, they are garenteed to drop at least 1 "robot part", a drop similar to shells which are unique to the Martian. These parts will be shown with the normal UI

          <img class=small src=gfx/the_drone_caller.png>
          <p>
            The Drone caller, The Martian's first active item. Use it to call down his drone, which (at first) shoots a bullet identical to the Zipper, however with no reload time. This item can be used as much as you like, but will only spawn one drone (at first). The drone is an AI similar to beadies spawned with the Eye of the Beholster

          <img class=small src=gfx/the_drone.png>
          <p>
            This is the drone which will be called down with the drone caller, enemies shot with by the drone have a 50% chance to drop at least 1 "robot part"
          </p>

          <h3 class=name> The Martian Wrench </h3>
          <img class=small src=gfx/the_martian_wrench.png>
          <p>
            This is the Martian Wrench, The Martian's second active item (The Martian character passvely is able to hold 2 active items). This item is used to upgrade The Drone. "Robot parts" will be used to upgrade the Drone with the wrench, and not having enough parts will make the wrench do nothing upon use. Upgrades start at 5 "robot parts", and will cost +5 "robot parts" every upgrade. Every 5 upgrade levels will allow you to spawn an additional drone with every use of the Drone caller.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upgrades each level are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Damage: +1 </li>
            <li> Fire Rate: +0.3 </li>
            <li> Shot speed: +1 </li>
            <li> Force: +0.7 </li>
            <li> Spread: -0.5 </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every 5 levels allow another drone to spawn!

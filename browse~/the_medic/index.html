          <p>
            It's a grenade that was one Bullet Kin. It switched sides, now working for the medic. It heals half a heart every three uses. After using, it will run at enemies, doing contact damage (kind of like the effect of Armor of Thorns) until death, upon which, it will explode and cause a large cloud of goop gas. Holding this item permits posion immunity.

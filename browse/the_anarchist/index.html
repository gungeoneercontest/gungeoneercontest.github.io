      <p>
        He is the leader of a rebel group against the Hegemony of man. He tells himself he wears the gas mask to protect himself from toxins but deep down he knows it is mainly to hide his utter terror when faced with death from his men.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Their headquarters got raided and he fled as quickly as he could leaving his members to die. He regrets that he didn't stand by his men to stop the hegemony and enters the Gungeon to fix his mistake. 
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p class=multiline> He spawns with the gas mask item and a 'smoke bomb' <img src=gfx/smoke_bomb.png>
        it is an active item which when activated creates a smoke screen in a 3x3 area where it was used nothing can be seen in the smoke and any enemies that enter or were already in it get disoriented (they are still hard to see by the player)
        can be used multiple times similar to the lockpick
      </p>

          <p>
            it is an item which when activated creates a smoke screen in a 3x3 area where it was used. if the enemy enters the smoke they get disoriented and get stuck in the smoke until it clears. they are hard to see when in the smoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the player steps into the smoke, enemies will fire blindly into it (not necessarily at you)
          </p>
          <p>
            can be used multiple times similar to the lockpick

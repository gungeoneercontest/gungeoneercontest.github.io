        An escaped Gunjurer.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        When they were called to defend the gungeon they decided to escape. They managed to do that but unfortunately a strange man (Resourceful rat in a Costume) Said he will call the alarm if he will not give him his spell book. He gives him his spellbook and escapes.  Now he realizes he could've fought back and wants to bring back his spell book.

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        If the character shoots the resourceful rat a special dialog will appear:

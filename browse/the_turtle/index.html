        The Turtle : “Look to the Past/Future” (the two words are glitched together - see design sheet)
      </p>
      <p>
        - A fearsome beast who few experienced gungeoneers recognise...
      </p> 
      <p>
        In the Breach : The Turtle is always in his shell, and always in a different place in the Breach. He can be dodgerolled over to prevent obstruction to the different rooms and NPCs. There is always a patch of light shining on him (by effect of Mural Fragment)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dodge Roll :
      </p>
      <p>
        All alterations by effect of passive - Aerodynamic Shell 
      </p>
      <p>
        (see design sheet for frame by frame of Turtle’s dodge roll) he enters his shell mid air
      </p>
      <p>
        - Dodge roll is extra long (same effect as red guon stone)
      </p>
      <p>
        - The Turtle can stay in his shell immediately after dodge rolling and continue rolling around while in his shell. In this state The Turtle can be hit, cannot shoot, and cannot dodge roll while in this state, but The Turtle deals increases contact damage and is much faster. Once The Turtle exits this state he is dizzy for short time, depending on how long he stayed in that state.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Unlock: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a character whose past has already been killed, shoot Super Space Turtle (acquired through normal gameplay) with the Gun That Can Kill The Past. -this will send you to a cutscene-
      </p>
      <p>
        - aforementioned Cutscene:
      </p>
      <p>
        We see the gungeon from the outside as it fast forwards and deteriorate as the magic fades from it. When the gungeon collapses (cutscene glitches because cutscene is shown through the magic of the gungeon but it is showing the future, when the gungeon has crumbled) we see it’s inhabitants (gungeoneers, NPCs, sentient items, some enemies) emerge from the rubble blinded by the light. Scene fast forwards again and we see a civilisation form on the island. After cities and laboratories have been built, we zoom in on one house in which a family of turtles, seemingly descendants of the Super Space Turtle, reside. We see two other characters (perhaps descendants of gun cultists) abduct the two turtle children. The scene cuts to a lab, where we see the two turtle brothers in adjacent rooms. The younger, smaller brother is brainwashed and outfitted with a astronaut helmet (to become the future/past SST) while the older turtle brother breaks free and escapes, passing a room filled with gungeon relics somewhere in the lab. The Turtle dashes out, only to trip on a Mural Fragment on the floor somewhere in the woody grounds of the lab. With tears in his eyes, in remembrance of his brothers capture, he grasps it in his hand, hoping to change their fate and teleports to the breach, where he immediately hides in his shell.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Past : Can only be attempted if SST is also acquired due to the intertwined nature of their pasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        - Gungeon glitches severely as it tries to transport The Turtle to his past, i.e the Gungeon’s future. The Turtle encounters his captors in a lab, where the Gun Cultists unleash many horrific and mutated creatures as they try to resurrect the gungeon Through an elaborate ritual involving the gungeon relics seen in the lab in the cutscene. The Turtle must defeat this horde of onslaught to prevent the re-rise of the gungeon, which glitches and effects the battle in unexpected ways. Once defeating his past, The Turtle,  instead of returning to the Breach, is transported bifrost-esque back to his home, where he reunites with his family.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        After finding the murderer of his lost friend, the Sheriff cornered him at the edge of a river. However, he walked into a trap and was ambushed by a group of cronies and the murderer and his eye was shot out. Seeking revenge, the sheriff is now prepared for the ambush and armed with the Gungeon's deadliest weapons. (Reference to Red Dead Redemption)

When the whip is "fired" or released, it almost instantly goes to where the mouse is before drawing back. It takes 1.5 seconds to fully charge the whip.

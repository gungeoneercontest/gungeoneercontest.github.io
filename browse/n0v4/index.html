      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        They're in the Gungeon after a horrible accident with N0V4's ship. N0V4 had been traveling the Universe, searching for materials to revive his son, but after a failed experiment, his son had got spirit linked with his father, as they both turned into spirits of rage. N0V4 wants to kill his past to let his son free and let him have peace as a normal spirit.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Bubby takes no damage and blocks bullets but N0V4 only has 1 heart. N0V4's active item, Spirit Charge (3), buffs Bubby with 2x his damage and +50% his normal size for 7 seconds. Recharge time: 1:15

          <h3 class=name> Bubby </h3>
          <p>
            As previously stated, Bubby blocks bullets and takes no damage. He shoots bullets with infinite round capacity with 18 damage per bullet and 2 bullets per second. During Spirit Rage, damage is increased to 36 damage per bullet and 5 bullets per second. Post Spirit Rage, damage gradually decreases back to 18 at a loss of 6 damage per second and a loss of 1bps (bullets per second) per second. Weapons collected from chests are absorbed by Bubby and grant a small stat boost dependent on weapon rank, damage, round capacity, and firing speed, ex. Machine Pistol gives fire rate up and Hexagun giving damage up.

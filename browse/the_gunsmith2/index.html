        A rugged veteran of the Hegemony’s harsh rule. Fights with his wits and his experience, but mostly his muscles.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        His workshop was raided and friends’ minds erased, all because he wasn’t powerful enough to stand up to the military team. He enters the gungeon to try and change that.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        His craftiness lets him work the munchers a little bit smoother, allowing him to coax rarer items from time to time. Also, he is able to repurpose empty guns into ammo that he can then hold in his capacity-increasing satchel.

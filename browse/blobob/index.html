        A runaway blobulon, come to the Gungeon to change their past. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        When Blobob was still a tiny blobulin, a Blobulonian Army officer arrived to take him into the ranks of the Blobulonian Army, as is customary among them. At the time, little Blobob had a teddy bear, let's call him "Blo," who he loved with all his heart. As the officer dragged him away from his home, Blobob's teddy bear fell out into a ditch, never to be seen again. After running away from the Blobulonian Army, because Blobob was the only blobulon that did not like fighting, he ended up stumbling across the Gungeon, where Blobob swore that he would not give up until he found Blo.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Normal blobulons do not attack Blobob, due to him being of the same kind as them. However, blobulon officers will have a small chance to appear in any room, and they attack Blobob along with multiple other blobulons, shouting "traitor! traitor!" Bloodbulons also attack Blobob, as they are so consumed by their rage that they pay no heed as to what they are attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting property that Blobob possesses is that he gains a 2% attack bonus from every new gun that he picks up and absorbs into his gooey body, but also suffers a 2% walking speed reduction for each additional gun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blobob can pick up armour, but after absorbing it it turns into half a heart.

          <h5 class=type> WEAPON </h5>
          <h3 class=name> Blobob's Favourite Hand </h3>
          <p>
            Blobob needs no weapons but his own body. Launches balls of deadly goo from his hand. The weapon has 2 stages of charge, similar to megahand. The first level of charge deals 4 points of damage, and costs half a heart to use. If it successfully hits an enemy, the health is restored. The charged attack costs 1 full heart to use, takes 1.2 seconds to charge and deals 40 damage. The heart container is fully refunded if the attack is successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            This weapon has a spread of 6 and a normal fire rate of 0.3

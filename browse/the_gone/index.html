      <p>
        He is a soul which has gone astray from his own beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was forced to commit to the ultimate betray, even thought he knew it was, and now he is gone from not only his home, but a part of himself.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        As a way of infinite torture or not, The Gone eventually finds The Gungeon, the only place he feels no one treats him either better or worst than what he deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stays in The Gungeon just for the sake of being in the same place, at least until he discovered he could no longer go back, and, poorly armed and maybe as fragile as ever, he now officially searches to kill his past again, even if that means breaking the morals even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the breach the few people that hang around in there always ask themselves what is what they want to "kill" in his past, The Gone always answers "Myself". After that everyone just stays in silence wondering the full meaning of it.
      </p>

      <p class=multiline> (More explicitly: 
        he is trying to change his mind, at the time when it wasn't too late
        he is trying to change decisions, decisions of the reality he wanted to see)
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Permanent flight. </li>
        <li> any other item that grants flight adds moving and dodgeroll speed except jetpack. </li>
        <li> No health. </li>
        <li> you cannot pick up either health or armor, instead it haves a 70% chance of re-rolling into another item and another 30 if the re-rolled item is still health or armor </li>
        <li> when his passive, "Sacred shield" is not fully charged, any shot will kill you instantly </li>
        <li> the only health item that affects you is the old crest, and the given armor can only be used before placing it on the altar as it will be gone when doing so </li>
      </ul>

          <h3 class=name> Potato gun </h3>
          <img src=gfx/potato_gun.png>
          <p>
            The potato gun is an electric pistol that is potato powered and also potato as in the adjective used to describe guns like the pilot's starter, it haves a wide spread, does 3 damage (the same pilot's starter does 5 per shot) but haves a clip size of 9 bullets and shoots with a fire rate of 3 bullets per second, and when emptying a whole clip, the potato the gun is using as a battery bakes from overheat (also the ammonomicon would say something about being popular for science fairs done in the gungeon).
          </p>

          <h5 class=type> PASSIVE </h5>
          <h3 class=name> Sacred shield </h3>
          <img src=gfx/sacred_shield.png>
          <p>
            Sacred shield is an item that gives you an extra hit every 750 damage dealt by the user as if it was an active one.
          </p>
          <p>
            It positions at the end of the health bar of the user (or replacing it, in the case of The Gone) but the old crest (which is the only armor you can pick up) will still not be protected by the sacred shield.
          </p>

          <p> <strong> Balancing: </strong> </p>
          <p>
            As any other active items do, in each floor the damage needed to recharge themselves is increased, however, as a balance feature this active charge will not, since in low floors you have less enemies with less health to recharge it, but there's no problem because if you pick this character, which is a challenge sort one, you should be "good" at the game to do so, so you won't need it as much as you will in higher floors, with more, and stronger enemies (also bosses could refill it 10-20% faster to get at least 2 or 3 charges in the highest ones).
          </p>

          <p> <strong> Synergies: </strong> </p>
          <h6> Master rounds: </h6>
          <p>
            -  Each master round (and only master rounds) instead of giving you heart containers (which you can't get) will make the sacred shield charge 5% faster up to a 25% with all 5 (or maybe somehow 50 I mean I don't know <.<)
          </p>

          <h6> *Ring of ethereal form: </h6>
 
          <p>
            This item is unlocked after killing The Gone's past, and when you get it while not being The Gone it needs 1500 damage to charge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also only when being The Gone ring of ethereal form will be sacrificed to not die whenever taking a hit without sacred shield charger (it would work like ration, but without being able to use it whenever you want)

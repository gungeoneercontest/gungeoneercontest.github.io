      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        The hermit had a seemingly perfect life nice house in subberbs, with a wife and pet ferrit. Enter Gordon, his next door nebour. His life long rival who finally had enough of seeing the hermit happy, decided it was time to do something. He had rigged guns to shoot the minute the door to his home opened. The hermit returning from a long day's work, saw his wife and pet murdered. Unfortunately society let him down and Gorden walked away free. The hermit fled to the wilderness to live a life of solitude. Some lost adventurer found him and informed him of the gungeon to witch he went.

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Upon completion of the past you unlock the pet ferrit. The ferrit loves chests and will lead you too the nearest one (upon room completion it will run to the door indicating the direction)
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past battle it would be cool to see a suburb seen with a road directly in the middle, with occasional cars to make things more challenging.

            Once per floor use. Mimicks the call of the birds fearsome leader, a request for treasure. The birds won't fall for the trick twice. They bring a random pickup (heart, blanks, shells or key) I left out armour and ammo as I feel it would be too overpowered

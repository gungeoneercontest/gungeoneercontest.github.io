      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        The Gambler had never lost a game of cards in his life... until he met 'The Dealer'. After just a few rounds he had lost almost everything to his name to that man who seemed to have the luck of the devil on his side... the only way he can even think of making his fortune back is to not accept the man's challenge... or he must defeat 'The Dealer' in one final game... one of life and death.

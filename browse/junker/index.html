      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>

        Sir junkan

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Like the robot gets a damage upgrade for each piece of junk 10 present and a new hart container every 2 junk and the starter weapon the stick may change to melee when right clicked and more likely to get drops on floor because he scavenges for it since he was sent to the wilderness  and his active is a vile with some serum he stole from some scientist it others heals or puts poison all around you but it takes 2x as long to hurt you while poison is on you but extra fast to  get hurt by fire while getting poison or fire damage you do extra damage
      </p>

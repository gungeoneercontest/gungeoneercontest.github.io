      <p>
        The Minstrel used to be a famous musician back home, but when he broke a string mid-song, a One Man band stole his reputation. Now, The Minstrel hopes to reverse his actions and kill the One Man band who stole everything from him...

            As The Minstrel kills more enemies, he gets a 0.5% fire rate increase. The max number of enemies killed is 200 until the ability ends (meaning he gets a max gain of 100%)...

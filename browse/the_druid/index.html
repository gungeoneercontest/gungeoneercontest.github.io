      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <h4> Story: </h4>
      <p>
        The ultimate crime a Druid can commit is failing to protect the Tree of Life. Tossed into the Gungeonto atone for his failings, the Druid despertly clings to any semblance of nature in the Gungeon.
      </p>

      <h4> Past Kill: </h4>

      <p>
        Long Ago, the Order of Druids was destined to protect the Tree of Life from any attacks. A Druid Circle was set up around the Tree to protect it from those who would seek to use it's powers for evil. But as the years passed, the elder Druids began to die, and the power of the circle waned. In that moment of weakness, the Overlord arrived, and killed the weak Elder Druids. Only the youngest survived, and tried to defend his home. The Overlord defeated him swiftly, and had him flung into the Gungeon, to repeat his horrible failure over and over, away from the light and the life of the surface.

            Similar to the Aged Bell, the Entangle Nut stops everything in the room from moving by ensnaring them in vines. After a few seconds, the vines collapse, creating spikey floor sections that must be avoided.

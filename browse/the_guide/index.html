        The Guide is a cheerful and charismatic con artist who takes unsuspecting tourists on mildly dangerous tours. He is gentle by nature and tried to use non-lethal weaponry to defend himself whenever possible. He loves money to a fault which is what got him into the tour business in the first place. He didn’t end up rich, but he made more money than if he was unemployed. When he arrived at the Gungeon he was not prepared. 
      </p>

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        On the edge of Hegemony controlled space most planets are either in the process of being colonized or deemed to hostile. However, one planet was just dangerous enough that it hadn’t been colonized, but not too dangerous to lead a tour group. What started as a get-rich-quick scheme ended up being a full time job for The Guide. There were plenty of crashed Hegemony ships from a past war. Not knowing the actual history, The Guide would invent famous battles. Between the fake history and exotic wildlife it made for a reliable tourist trap. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It all went wrong when an alien hive mind landed on the planet. If only he destroyed it when it was alone and not tried to incorporate it into the tour, the planet might not be occupied by an alien horde. Needless to say the planet has been terraformed beyond all recognition. The Guide was about to make a career change when he heard about the Gungeon. He’s doing it for the money.

          <p>
            After other precautions failed, The Guide realized he needed something to put down an aggressive animal before it ate one of the tourists. When he asked the the salesman at the firearms store for a cheap self-defense weapon he was handed a Glock 9mm.

          <h3 class=name> BB Gun </h3>
          <img src=gfx/bb_gun.png>
          <p>
            The Guide bought this to scare away the animals that got to close without hurting them. To his horror he discovered that it did neither of these things. He kept it because the ammo was cheap and it helped him ‘look the part’.

          <p>
            After the The Guide arrived at the Gungeon, he sold his key for 20 shells. He has an eye for finding change other people miss. He finds 5% more shells when clearing rooms, defeating bosses, and selling stuff to Sell Creep.

            Shoots electrical wires at a single target. If the target is hit they are stunned for five seconds. While stunned the target takes double damage from attacks and cannot move or attack. The taser recharges after 30 seconds.

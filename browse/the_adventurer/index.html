      <p>
        A rather young, but sharp-dressed dude. Loves history, grew up watching many action movies and learning about all the famous exploits of many heroes throughout history. Naturally a risk-taker, and loves to explore the outdoors and adventure.
      </p>

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        One day, while exploring the woods, The Adventurer got lost. Unsure of where to go, he eventually met a nice girl named Aishi (with pink hair, of course) who offered him shelter and cared for him. The two naturally bonded together, but Aishi became a bit clingy with him. Eventually The Adventurer wanted to return home (his parents were on a business trip, the usual stuff, so they were probably thinking he was OK), but Aishi insisted he stay. Eventually, Aishi grew more and more possessive of him, and The Adventurer straight up cut all ties with her and ran off. This angered Aishi, who pursued The Adventurer through the woods, eventually turning into a terrifying dragon. The Adventurer eventually encountered a small town while he was running away, and begged to spend the night there hidden away so Aishi couldn't find him. However, Aishi tracked him down to the town and proceeded to burn the entire place down looking for him. The Adventurer survived and managed to escape, but he had been quite scarred from the incident and felt a huge degree of guilt for allowing innocent people to be burned. Realizing that was the exact opposite of what he aspired to be as a hero, The Adventurer wanted to atone for his actions. In school eventually he heard rumors of a place called "The Gungeon" and the supposed treasure it hid: a gun that could kill the past. Realizing this could be a chance at redemption, he scoured around everywhere he could look hoping to find the place and claim the gun so he could save the town that had been too kind to him in the past. This time, he won't run away.

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        3 hearts, 2 blanks, the same start as characters normally start with. Being a highschool age boy, he's naturally more lightweight. He can dodge roll a bit faster than the default speed, but takes more knockback.

          <p> <em> "Rule of Cool" </em> </p>

          <p>
            Classic firearm adored by action movies protagonists and mall ninjas everywhere. The adventurer just HAD to get one and use it as his sidearm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Firing a .50 caliber round isn't easy for a grown man, much less a kid who has had little experience with firearms other than watching other guys do it on TV. This weapon is notorious for jamming a lot, and snapping the wrists of unprepared shooters.

          <p>
            Sometimes, the most risky things can feel the most exhilarating or rewarding. The rush of a rollercoaster, the adrenaline rush from a sports car, the thrill of running through a gunfight with bullets flying everywhere! It's fun to savor the moment, knowing you might not get another."
          </p>

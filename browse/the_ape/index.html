      <p>
        He is an old ape with white hair. The Ape is a seasoned melee fighter and is a little bulkier than other characters. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        The ape is trying to kill their father's Italian captor, a task he failed when he was a child.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        The Ape starts with an extra heart and has a larger hitbox than the other characters. When holding the barrel or banana gun he receives a small damage boost. He also has a distrust for mustachioed characters and growls at them (no effect on gamepplay).

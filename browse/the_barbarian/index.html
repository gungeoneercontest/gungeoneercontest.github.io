      <p>
        The Barbarian was the leader of a small fleet of space bandits who wreaked havoc on all ships, enacting years of plunder and destruction. The group was well known; along with their propensity for creating terror, they were strangely seen sporting delicate, pink weapons in the midst of battle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a day passed without the Imperial Hegemony of Man loudly advertising the increased bounties on the heads of the “Pink Pack”. While space bandits were not anything new, the Pack constantly managed to harass merchant ships without getting caught and made quite the dent on Hegemony morale. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, word got around that the man mainly responsible for the Pack’s untouchability was the Barbarian. Known for his ruthless and reckless style of battle, the Barbarian struck fear into the hearts of even the most stoic of soldiers. Accompanied by the sound of his fellow bandits docking, most ships know things are over when they hear his famous battle cry.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        In order to eliminate the Barbarian, the Imperial Hegemony of Man, as a last resort, paid an infamous hitman to pose as an innocuous merchant ship in an isolated galaxy. Seizing the opportunity to gain more loot, the Barbarian ordered his ships to move in, only to find that half his fleet was soon overtaken by the hitman’s hidden compatriots. Overwhelmed by the opposition’s superior technology and power, the remaining bandits realize the futility of their battle. In a final effort to save him, they force the Barbarian into an escape pod, leaving him to only watch helplessly as the last of his men are slain by the assassin. The Barbarian later enters the Gungeon in hopes that he can kill his past and take revenge on the Hitman.

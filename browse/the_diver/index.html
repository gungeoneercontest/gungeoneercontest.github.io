        The Diver was once a sailor travelling the Gungeon's surrounding waters. Having to wear a diving suit to seek treasure in the waters, one expedition was interrupted by an eight-arm beast with just as many guns. Left for dead with a leg, a vessel, and crew taken away from them, The Diver drifts onto the shores of the Gungeon with numerous mutations.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Suddenly attacked by Moby-Flick, or The Glocktopus, the Diver and their crew had no info on how to deal with this new monstrosity, and failed to fight it off. Left for dead, the Diver drifted to shore with mutations and a diving dress. The past they seek to kill is the reality that Moby-Flick eliminated the Diver's crew.

      <p>
        The Afflicted is a character that loses hearts before armor and has 2 different playstyles which changes depending on whether or not he has armor. He can take advantage of common heart drops while still conserving his armor which can make him relatively tanky. And on the flip side, you could purposefully get hit enough times to remove your armor and take advantage of his high risk high reward unarmored playstyle which gives him a decent amount of curse but boosts his offensive potential.

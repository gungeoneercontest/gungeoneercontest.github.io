        Mr. Flippers is a penguin that is searching for a way to rid himself of his thoughts  about his dead village and get a second chance at killing Sargent Fluffy Bottom.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        It was a peaceful day in the Arctic where Mr. Flippers had his son and wife in an igloo, until suddenly his whole village was attacked by polar bears and the leader of the polar bears, Sergeant Fluffy Bottom (name interchangeable). His whole village was ripped to shreds and then some. Flippers grabbed his wife, son, and harpoon gun and ran but his wife tripped and Sergeant Fluffy Bottom got her, tore her in two, and threw her parts in the water in front of him. Filled with anger, Mr. Flippers grabbed his harpoon gun (that he found when it washed ashore from a whaling ship) and tried to show the Sergeant, but before he could shoot the sergeant clawed him into the water. Mr. Flippers fell into the ocean unconscious and bleeding from the Sergeantâ€™s attack. His son, standing in front of the sergeant, grabs the harpoon gun and jumps into the water. The sergeant ignores this and continues to kill the rest of the village. Later on Mr. Flippers washes up on a distant shore with nothing but his son, a harpoon gun, some fish in his mouth, and piece of paper that speaks of a gun that can kill the past. Mr. Flippers and his son Charles go off to find that gun so they can erase this horrible memory and get a second chance at Sergeant Fluffy Bottom.

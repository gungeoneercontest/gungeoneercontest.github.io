        He's a man... or was a man. The Rider looks much more different than he did before, unrecognizable. So much, that he decides to hide half of his face.
      </p>
      <p>      
        His abilities in-game:
      </p>
      <p>
        Innate 2 coolness and 2 curse. Has a primary weapon and an active item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hell Chain: A chain that takes a second to charge up and can hit up to three enemies in a close to medium range. Does damage and lights enemies on fire. The chain, a melee weapon disapproved by the Gungeon, is the reason for his innate curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motorcycle: The Rider can ride a motorcycle to achieve faster speeds for a few seconds. While on his motorcycle, The Rider has very bad accuracy with any weapon other than his chain. He can still do a dodge roll on the motorcycle. Motorcycle is the reason for his innate coolness.
      </p>

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        He made a mistake. In a life-or-death situation, something (or someone) came to him and offered to get him out (for a price; it turned him into a being that he doesn't like, and gave him special abilities.). The situation could be some sort of biker gang violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he goes to his past, he goes back to this place and he must not accept the deal this figure offered, but instead fight multiple (2 to 3) mini-bosses. In the end, the thing that turned him in the first place would not be happy with his decision, and he'd have to kill it too.
      </p>

      <h3> Items </h3>

          <h5 class=type> WEAPON </h5>
          <h3 class=name> Hell Chain </h3>
          <p>
            Melee, but a pretty decent range. Charge up time of 1 second. Hits up to 3 enemies, does 10 damage and also sets them on fire.

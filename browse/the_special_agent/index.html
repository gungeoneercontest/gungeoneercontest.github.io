      <p>
        The Special Agent is a government detective. While a capable gun fighter, he is best known for his unique investigatory techniques, which have resulted in him being assigned to more supernatural cases.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        While investigating a series of grisly murders, The Special Agent tracked the killer to a mysterious portal. He attempted to apprehend the killer, but failed due to his imperfect courage. Twenty-five years later, the Special Agent enters the Gungeon determined to confront his failure, put an end to the killer, and rewrite the past for the victims.

        A risk/reward based character with a slow but powerful starting weapon and an active item based on zoning the enemies.

      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        He was going around on his pirate spaceship, doing his space-plundering, when his crew, unhappy with the low cut of the space-loot, mutinied. They took control, stopped the ship off at the nearest place they could find, which happened to be the gungeon, and marooned the pirate there. His past would involve stopping the mutiny by fighting three weak bosses, each a member of his crew.

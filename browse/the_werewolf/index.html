      <p>
        The Werewolf is from an ancient humanoid werewolf tribe that worshiped the gun that killed the past along the cult of the gundead, however since they dealt and betrayed the gungeon by working with the hegemony to raid and conquer the gungeon and failed (same reason why treadnaught's tank is there, it is a hegemony weapon left behind), they are hated and cursed by the gungeon and the gundead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They were hunted down to be killed. The werewolf being one of the few children to escape back then, he headed to the hegemony capital only to be treated with hate and racism beyond anyone could handle, thus he had to get dirty to survive, stealing from shops, people, houses and anything he can come by from food to clothing and jewelry to be able to survive.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        After being caught on one heist, he is sent to an extremely harsh prison run by the hegemony, there an old man attempts to befriend him over many times. The werewolf refuses at first, but finds himself attached to him later on. When they do become friends, the other inmates kill him out of hate for the werewolf, driving him angry and leading to the werewolf massacring more than 90% of the inmates (at least a 1000). 
      </p>
      <p>
        He escaped the prison and found himself facing he gungeon after some time in the wild. After remembering the legends and stories by the old man, they decide to go in and get him back.
      </p>
      <p>
        His past is that he returns to his cell and forces his way out. He tells the old man to escape with him and grabs him, killing anyone in their way and stealing their guns (since he is a master thief and uses his claws at first). Before the boss room which is the outer yard, there's the belongings room where the player can find a random quality chest (tier B and up) that gives him a weapon, this is a reference to jails in skyrim where the player can find their items in a chest in some area.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reaching the boss whom is the warden, a cutscene plays where he looks down on them and snipers attempt to shoot the werewolf but the old man takes the hit. Just before dying, the old man talks to him as if he knows he has been into the gungeon and is attempting to kill his past. "People die. its the way of life, and im old already, but you....you're young. you still have time, have a life to do things and accomplish dreams. Go out there. Forget about me. GO AND LIVE ON!! But thank you, for sharing me my last days" this results in the werewolf dealing twice as much damage and DPS cap being removed off the warden. 
      </p>
      <p>
        killing his past unlocks the "Ancient Guon Stones" that blank when they are hit, but need to recharge their powers for some time (a minute) before being able to blank again. These have a synergy with the Elder Blank which gives the Elder Blank a 300 blank damage special. 
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        - He is cursed by the gungeon thus he always starts with a curse of three and all shrines cannot be used for he is from a tribe of heretics and the gungeon wants him out.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He cannot use armor for it slows him down.
      </p>
      <p>
        - He starts with 5 hearts and 2 blanks which is fair since he has a curse right at the beginning and an item that increases curse (covered later)
      </p>
      <p>
        - He is faster than other gungeoneers and can roll a slightly longer distance, since he is a werewolf.
      </p>
      <p class=multiline> - Since he is cursed, chest rates have been changed to increase his anger and frustration to:
        1/2/oub: D15%, C40%, B40%, A3%, S2%
        3/abbey: D15%, C40%, B35%, A5%, S5%
        4             : D10%, C45%, B45%, A5%, S5%
        5             : D5%, C35%, B45%, A10%, S5%
      </p>
      <p>
        - Bosses deal 1 heart of damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Rainbow chests never spawn.
      </p>
      <p class=multiline> - NPCs do not care much, but they did hear the news so all shops increase their prices, except for bello and blacksmith, prices are updated to the formula:
        shop price * 1.25
        Also the blacksmith and bello should be talked to and then they will empathize with the werewolf after hearing his story and open up shop. This is a reference to the relationship between the shield hero and the blacksmith from "The rising of the shield hero" light novel.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Although being a master thief, he chooses to not steal from bello and the blacksmith. And due to the friendship with both of them, he can fire as much as he'd like in their shops.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Items </h3>
      <div class=kit>
        <div class=item>
          <h5 class=type> WEAPON </h5>
          <h3 class=name> Lumberjack's sidearm </h3>
          <p>
            A semiautomatic gun with a magazine size of 9, infinite ammo, reload time of 1.5 seconds, damage of 12 and same knockback, speed and range as that of the rusty sidearm of the hunter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weapon's name suggests that the werewolf stole this from a lumberjack during his time in the wild. It is not known if he killed him or not, however it could be a reference to Red Riding Hood.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class=item>
          <h5 class=type> WEAPON </h5>
          <h3 class=name> Claws </h3>
          <p class=multiline> When ammo runs out, the werewolf has to result to primitive ways of fighting! 
            He uses his claws that deal 16 damage, have a fire rate of 0.40 and force and spread of 15. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Active Item that lets the werewolf howl, giving him a temporary *1.25 damage boost of his current weapon and making non-jammed enemies run away without firing for some time (5 seconds) but has a risk, 50% of non-jammed enemies become jammed due to how angry they are at themselves for being scared from the heretic! 
          </p>
          <p>
            Beast howl is a reference to the werewolf howl in Skyrim.

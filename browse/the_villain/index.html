        'An electric-like evil robotic hybrid, the cookie-cutter antagonist of some untold grand story (filled with many sequels and profitable merchandise, sold in many fine retail stores in your tri-state area!)'
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality the villain is simply the new antagonist in Devolver Digital's future game called "Lint." However with Fork Parker's greedy ways the games concept is simply a redone mechanic and is rushed to production, ending in a major flop in revenue for the company.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Guns cannot drop in chests or as loot, and if somehow still able to be in the villain's reach, he cannot hold them. Bullet modifiers are still able to be droppable loot and have a higher chance of dropping passives than actives. Immune to shock damage.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        'To rid of that damned hero, always easily defeating his plans as if it was a rushed story plot with no real consideration for quality!'
      </p>
      <p>
        However with a new eye in his world the hero might not be the only thing he might get rid of...
      </p>

      <h3> Past Boss </h3>
      <video src=vid/past_boss.mp4 autoplay loop></video>

      <p>
        Once shooting the gun that can kill the past, he reappears back to a forgotten place that he vaguely remembers, its his lair! With all of his memories flooding back from that time he remember what happened here, where the Hero easily beat the Villain, causing the Villain to escape into a rocket off the planet before blowing up his elaborate lair. However, the Villain believes that with his new skill and tech, he can have the chance to finally defeat the Hero! But before the Hero finishes his speech, the Villain notices something he never had seen before, an enormous glass screen stretching across the entire lair, how had he never seen it before, and why was there a giant in front of the glass? He then sees the giant doing something that changed the Villain forever, was he... controlling the Hero? The thought then pieced itself together and struck the Villain hard... All of the strange things he saw that were impossible, like how objects fell through the floor, and how the Hero always came back alive even though the Villain had clearly killed him, all of a sudden made sense. He was just a video game character, and not even a good one at that. With new found rage at the poor game that he realized he was in, he set on breaking the game, as well as all of its creators bones. But should he? Does he even have the power to do such an unspeakable act? Or Should he simply follow his coding, fail once more, and happily be stuck in the Gungeon?
      </p>

      <img class=big src=gfx/the_hero.gif>

      <p>
        The Hero: The protagonist of The Villains past, and the person that somehow manages to foil all of the Villains schemes to defeat him. Stratus Ordeal is a large, muscular, totally lovable, and extremely handsome hero that is always the players favorite, no matter what, and the player will buy all of the merchandise featuring Cirrus Sidestep's gorgeous face, right? Cumulonimbus Movement always carries his hulking 'Guster Sword' anywhere he goes and due to a bug in the game will always be lvl 100+ at the final boss, making him an almost impossible foe for Villain to defeat. Has the strange tendency to change his name whenever its spoken.
      </p>

      <img class=big src=gfx/villain_full.gif>
      <p>
        The Villain: The most meanest and ugliest son of a gun in the whole planet, the main antagonist. His secret lair is in a volcano on a desert island which contains an obvious means of self-destruction that once initiated, cannot be aborted. The Villain wants to defeat the Hero because he knocked over his cup of juice when they were little kids, and the cup was still full! Cannot stop saying evil quotes and monologues way too much.

      <h3> TRUE PAST BOSS </h3>
      <video src=vid/true_past_boss.mp4 autoplay loop></video>

      <p>
        Once the Villain "goes rogue" he blanks the computer glass, glitches out of his poorly made video game, and finds himself in a strange world where fantasy and sci-fi are replaced with taxes and bills, in other words, the real world. Now inside of Devolver HQ, the Villain wreaks havoc onto interns, developers, and employees desperate to find the leader of the whole operation until finding the large office of the one and only, Fork Parker. After finding the old man and finding out that he is the puppet master behind this whole scheme, Fork then scrambles to a huge, complex machine and implants his conscious inside of a towering robotic clone of himself that he deems is, "A cooler version of me that I forced my interns to make," becoming the true past boss. Once enough damage is done to Fork Parkinator the protective skin begins to peel off, revealing his metal skeleton and receives more damage from electricity, but also takes out the big guns and becomes a harder foe in return. Once the towering boss is dealt with, the machine goes into overdrive and spits out the real Fork Parker, which can be killed with a measly 1 HP. With Fork Parker now being dead, the production of "Lint" is handed to another director, who changes and alters much of the story, mechanic, and concept, turning it into another year winning video game from Devolver Digital. Now with the help of the new director, 'The Villain' has turned to 'TESL4' and instead of being the laughing stock mascot of every bland, cliched antagonist, he is now revered for being a unique and remarkably difficult foe, gaining more love from the community than the actual protagonist.
      </p>

      <img class=big src=gfx/glitched_villain_full.gif>
      <p>
        The Skin that The Villain takes while fighting the past boss, glitched due to the properties the real world has on him. Once his past is defeated he is able to use this as his B-skin.

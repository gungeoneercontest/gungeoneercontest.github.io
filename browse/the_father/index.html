        In a world filled with heroes and adventurers seeking fame or redemption, The Father is... just a father. A father who lost his only son.

        After the death of his only son, The Father seeks the Gun That Can Kill The Past in order to go back when his son was alive. Only through the Gungeon can he discover why his beloved son passed away and prevent it from happening again.

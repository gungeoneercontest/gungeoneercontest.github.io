      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        The First Cyborg.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dying of an unnameable disease, this man turned to illegal science to save his life. The scientist was able to prolong his life - but only through the use of illegal methods: he made the man into a cyborg. Now his robotic parts sustain him, but when the government catches wind of the scientist's research facility, they come to destroy him. Originally subdued and imprisoned by the government agents, he wishes he had had the capabilities to fight to freedom - and save the scientist who saved him.

          <p>
            The Cyborg was designed with survival in mind, getting hit just makes him that much tougher. Robotic Regeneration allows his robotic parts a chance to generate protective blanks whenever he gets hit.

        A synthetic warrior, filled to the brim with a myriad of experimental Hegemony technology.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? </h3>
      <p>
        The hybrid was originally an investigator, sent to uncover some shady deals conducted by the Hegemony's Ministry of Warfare. But in the following case things turned south quickly, which lead her in hot pursuit of the mad scientists behind this whole situation. What she found instead was a twisted Frankenstein's monster of their minds, an experimental war tank armed with a biological weapon capable of turning civilians into synthetic soldiers. She put up a brave resistance but ultimately they got her, and she became their first servant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, she managed to force herself into the gungeon where nobody could be her puppetmaster. The hybrid wants to break her chains, destroying the technology that made her what she is before it has the chance to rip her humanity away.

          <img class=big src=gfx/subjugator.png>
          <p>
            The Subjugator is gun with rudimentary AI built into it, by default setting the gun’s mode to subdue. While accurate and far reaching, the gun lacks in firepower in this state. When the hybrid is at critical health (one heart of health or less) or faces a significant threat (large enemy/boss), the Subjugator recognizes the challenge and shifts to elimination mode. This mode trades a bit of accuracy for a needed boost to damage.

        <em> "A Hegemony cyborg tank, piloted by an impossibly illegal patchwork of the very designs that designed it." </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Following a haywire investigation into the Ministry of Warfare, Totsuka Scarlet tracked her pursuer(s...?) all the way to the underbelly of NINEMM Tower only to realize she was trapped. Outgunned and without weapons, a less prepared officer would have been forced to let these mad scientist imprison her and be subject to their experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        But through channeling the mystical dodge roll, Investigator Scarlet managed to weave herself out of danger and trick the behemoth into destroying itself. With her targets crushed under their own weight she rode off into the sunset, satisfied that the technology faced that day might never be used again."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
        For this fight, the hybrid (Investigator Scarlet at the time) has no passive items but is assisted by her subjugator in 'elimination mode', it not being locked by the Civil Spider's reprogramming nanomachines yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Civil Spider will shoot an unending stream of bullets, but also fire pulses of nanomachine gas (these can be visualized as blue cloud bullets). When hit by these clouds the hybrid loses a heart and gains an armor, just like if the Meld Engine was used.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first phase will be combat, but after a point will lock the gun and force it incapable of fire. From there the Hybrid will need to run across the halls of the arena tricking the Civil Spider into ramming itself against debris. With a couple dodge rolls to escape the crumbling arena, the Hybrid will have claimed victory.

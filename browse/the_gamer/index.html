      <p>
        The Gamer is a character inspired by and made with gamer/gaming stereotypes in-mind. From looking red-eye, greasy, and as if he hasn't seen the sun in 2 months, to bringing gaming equipment to aid him in his journey into the Gungeon. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Why are they in the Gungeon? What's the past they are trying to kill? </h3>
      <p>
        Being one to hold a grudge, The Gamer's story is one of revenge. He travels into this mysterious gun-theme dungeon looking for the Gun That can Kill the Past, with his plan to go back to that horrible day; the day he lost to another player in a 1v1 on his favorite shooter. With many more years of that game under his belt, he's sure that he'll beat this player with this second chance.
      </p>

      <h3> Special attributes </h3>
      <p>
        Apart from the normal the other characters have (One key, three hearts, etc.), some differences The Gamer has are better aim and a slightly improved dodge-roll. Everything else is pretty much normal.

            Upon use in a room full of enemies, the player will be able to control one random enemy within the room. (Doesn't work with bosses.) The main character will stay stationary when controlling an enemy, and blanks will be used automatically if a bullet is about to hit the main character. Player can quickly switch out of an enemy either by using the active again, or by waiting for the controlled enemy to die.
